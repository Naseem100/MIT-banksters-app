| April 21: Choose laser and fingerprint sensors, as well as 7 segment display and LEDs                                                           | Show that parts have been ordered                                                                         |
| April 21: Wire the components to the ESP32 and make sure that components are able to send and receive data                                      | Plot sensor info on Serial monitor and show that the 7 segment display can display numbers                |
| April 21: Begin and finish creating the web form using HTML/CSS + thinking of useful information fields                                         | Show the webpage in action in a video + show HTML/CSS code                                                |

| April 28: Calibrate the lasers to accurately increment/decrement a counter as well as display it on the 7 segment display                       | Show streaming sensor values on Serial monitor as counter is changed by walking through laser             |
| April 28: Calibrate the fingerprint sensor and finish writing a function to match two fingerprints together                                     | Show streaming sensor values on Serial monitor as the fingerprint is changed by scanning someone's finger |
| May 5: Finish writing a script to take in fingerprint data and post to the team server                                                          | Show streaming sensor values on Serial monitor and the returned char-array value to ensure they are equal |
| May 5: Finish writing a script to increment a person counter and post to the team server if certain conditions are met                          | Show streaming sensor values and the returned total increment value on Serial monitor                     |
| May 5: Finish writing script that takes data from each database and lights up LED and increments 7 segment display counter when someone passes  | Show a video of the system working while streaming sensor values on Serial monitor to ensure correct data |
| May 12: Finish soldering all components together and adding any last comments to the code                                                       | Show all the final code and comments in the project reports                                               |
